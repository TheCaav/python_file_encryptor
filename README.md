# What is this
Python scripts to en- and decrypt files in a folder

# Is it usable
It does stuff, but I have never really finished this project, so many paths and filenames are hardcoded. This might change in the future.

# Concerns
This project is not claimed to be cryptographically or even physically safe, so you better not use it.
